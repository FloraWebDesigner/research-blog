            </h1>
            <p class="p1">Aritzia is a Canadian clothing retailer targeted towards young North American women based in
                Vancouver,
                British Columbia. It positions itself as a design house with an innovative global platform.</p>

            <p>
                More than forty years ago, the Hill family pioneered a special product called "Aritzia" in a 70-year-old
                department store in Vancouver, Canada. In 1984, Brian Hill then opened the first independent Aritzia
                boutique in his hometown's upscale shopping center, Oakridge Centre, with a simple idea: offer beautiful
                clothes in aspirational spaces with exceptional service. A few decades later, the idea was renamed to
                Everyday Luxury.

                steady except for a sales decline in 2020 due to COVID-19.

            <p>
                Aritzia was ranked fourth in FY2023 revenue with sales revenue of 1.07 million US dollars. It is now one
                of
                the major domestic apparel retailers who also have a strong operational presence in the US according to
                a
                Canada Apparel Retail industry profile released by MarketLine last September. Unlike Walmart, TJX and
                HBC,
                which are large chains in the general category, Aritzia specializes in the apparel has its own original
                sub-brands.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes Aritzia a leading player in the apparel field? The answer is its distinct brand value, which
                is
                also the secret of Aritzia's success that is highly favored by the consumer market.
            </p>
            <h2>Research Method</h2>
            <p>This essay will discuss Aritzia's brand competitiveness through historical research,Porter's Five
                Forces model and social media analysis.</p>
            <p>As a homegrown Canadian brand, Aritzia's brand positioning and strategy in the consumer market is very
                unique. This paper will begin with a historical study to reveal Aritzia's brand development strategy,
                which
                will lead to further detailed case study by Porter's power of buyers versus its
                supply capacity on its internal inventory strategy. Last summer Aritzia experienced a significant drop
                in
                sales due to inventory issues, which became the focus of major news. At this sensitive point in time, in
                conjunction with the current strategic layout of Aritzia, this paper will further identify the problems
                that
                the company has and make relevant recommendations.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, social media forum analytics will be used to bring in reviews, comments and suggestions
                about
                Aritzia from a consumer perspective.</p>
            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>Aritzia defines its brand values as Creativity, Loyalty, Excellence, Good Judgement, Integrity, and
                Teamwork.</p>

                The founder Hill family who started business with a department store has a keen market insight and
                market
                strategy layout, making Aritzia different from other brands. The Hill family applied the concept of the
                department store to the brand design, making Aritzia more varied and differentiated from its apparel
                competitors, making it unique in the marketplace.
            </p>
            <h2>Historical Research</h2>
            <p>
                The Hill family, which started out in department stores, has extraordinary business talent, and from the
                opening of the first boutique in 1984, a luxury brand was born and began its layout.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is a timeline of the brand's development, and it's clear to see that every historical process has
                been
                well thought out.

            </div>
            <p>
                Over the past four decades, the history of brand development has been characterized by events that can
                be
                broadly divided into two categories: product expansion and geographical expansion.</p>

            <p>
                Aritzia's first sub-brand was created in the tenth year after the opening of the boutique, and another
                decade later, TNA, a sports-focus brand was born. Later, it took only four years for the next Wilfred to
                meet the consumer. The craftsmanship of these brand segments and a decade of product study and consumer
                market positioning have made Aritzia a leading player in the market. These brand categories have not
                been
                eliminated by the flood of time, but rather seems to be particularly active and competitive in the
                market
                and loved by consumers!
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides, Aritzia seems very patient. Its expansion was relatively slow at the beginning, and as the
                brand
                became more mature, more and more stores were opened. The chart below shows the trend in the number of
                stores in the U.S. and Canada from FY15 to FY23.
            </p>
            <div class="chart">

                    title="Aritzia's Store Numbers" width="630">
            </div>
            <div class="source">Data source: statistic, Aritzia - Annual Report 2023</div>

            <p>
                Since FY2020 (2019), Aritzia has almost stopped expanding in the Canadian market, while the number of
                boutiques in the U.S. has instead been on the rise. Aritzia then became the market leader but the brand
                is
                becoming increasingly saturated in the Canadian market. In such a case, opening up new territories to
                expand
                sales and marketing footprints is imperative.
                There is no doubt that the U.S. market has a greater market share and growth prospects, especially for
                Aritzia, a brand that has existed for two decades in local Canada. Its latest YTD2024 earnings report
                shows
                U.S. sales revenue of 875million, capturing 51.9% of the market share, overtaking Canada with a store
                count
                of 46, 22 less than that of Canada. It has also boosted his cash flow and assets by leaps and bounds, as
                the
                opening of boutiques and flagship stores in the U.S. has sucked in investors.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Aritzia is a homegrown Canadian brand that has excelled and been loved by consumers for over forty
                    years
                    with a deep commitment to quality control, innovation and marketing strategy. However, supply chain
                    issues within Aritzia last quarter resulted in a significant decline in sales. In a highly
                    competitive
                    market, it is important to respond and maintain the brand's purity and innovation. The brand's
                    future
                    plan is to quickly enter the U.S. and capture the market.

                    This paper summarizes Aritzia's development strategy and brand positioning through historical
                    research,
                    and analyze its pricing strategy. In terms of Aritzia's performance last quarter, this paper
                    identifies
                    the dilemmas currently faced by Aritzia and proposes recommendations of its internal data track,
                    external marketing approach and strategic level rebranding by comparing its branding and positioning
                    with Zara,. The paper also analyzes the development of its A-ok brand, as well as a comparative
                    analysis
                    of Aritzia's sales in the U.S. and Canadian markets, comprehensively demonstrating Aritiza's
                    competitiveness in the market.

                    <p>Aritzia uses its brand story to illustrate the positioning of the complete line as well as their
                        unique craftsmanship and consumer insights.</p>

                    <p>Zara's market positioning is very different from Aritzia's, and its rapid U.S. hyperbole confirms
                        the market advantage and value of limited editions of high-end products, a perfect attempt to
                        define a clothing brand as a premium luxury product.</p>
